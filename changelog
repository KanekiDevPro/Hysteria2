# [1.11.0] - 2025-05-28


#### ⚠️ Attention Required

🚨 **Important:** Due to changes in the `normalsub` system (now using passwords in links and routing through Caddy),
you must **re-activate NormalSUB** from the settings panel after upgrading to **v1.11.0**.

Failure to do so may result in broken subscription links.

#### ✨ Features & Improvements

* 🔐 **normalsub:** Use **user password** instead of username in subscription path for improved privacy (harder to enumerate users)
* 🔁 **normalsub:** Now uses **Caddy** as a reverse proxy for better performance and flexibility
* 🧩 **WARP API:** Adapted backend to support **JSON-based status output**
* 🛠️ **Script Update:** WARP status script now outputs clean **JSON**, allowing easier parsing and integration
